In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with memory management and object lifecycles, especially when using delegates or blocks.  The problem manifests when a delegate or block retains a reference to an object that's already been deallocated. This often leads to crashes or unexpected behavior, especially when trying to access properties or methods of the deallocated object. For instance, if a view controller is deallocated, but a timer or network request still holds a strong reference to it via a block, attempting to use the view controller after deallocation results in a crash. The retain cycle between objects might also cause memory leaks if not carefully handled.  This frequently occurs in situations involving asynchronous operations where completion handlers maintain strong references.
